# Comprehensive Function Documentation
These rules ensure that all code generated or modified by the AI adheres to a high standard of documentation, making the codebase clear, maintainable, and easy for both developers and AI to navigate. The primary focus is on consistent and thorough function documentation.
## General Guidelines
1. **Mandatory Documentation**: Every function, method, or class method (regardless of language) must be documented using the appropriate documentation standard for the language: - **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Use JSDoc.
**Python**: Use restructuredText (reST) docstrings.
**PHP**: Use PHPDoc.
**Java**: Use Javadoc.
- **Other languages**: Use the most widely accepted documentation standard (e.g., RDoc for Ruby).
2. **Consistency: Follow the same documentation style and structure across the entire project to ensure uniformity.
3. **Context Awareness**: Before generating new functions, check the existing codebase for similar functionality to avoid duplication. If a similar function exists, suggest reusing it instead of creating a new one.
4. **Clarity**: Documentation must be concise yet descriptive, avoiding vague terms like "processes data" or "handles stuff." Specify *what* the function does, "how it does it (if complex), and why it exists (if not obvious).
## Documentation Requirements for Functions
For every function or method, include the following in the documentation:
1. **Description**:
- Provide a clear, one to two-sentence explanation of what the function does.
Include the purpose or context if it's not immediately obvious (e.g., "Used in the checkout flow to calculate discounts"). **Parameters**:
- List all parameters, including their type (if applicable in the language).
- Describe what each parameter represents and any constraints (e.g., "Must be a positive integer").
For optional parameters, indicate default values or behavior when omitted.
3. **Return Value**:
Specify the return type (if applicable) and what the return value represents.
If the function returns 'None" or "null", explicitly state this.
4. **Examples** (for complex functions):
Include at least one usage example for functions with non-trivial logic (e.g., involving multiple parameters or edge cases). - Use code snippets to show typical input and output.
5. **Exceptions/Errors** (if applicable):
Document any errors or exceptions the function may throw, including conditions that trigger them.
6. **Side Effects** (if applicable):
- Note if the function modifies external state (e.g., updates a database, changes global variables). 7. **Deprecation** (if applicable):
- If the function is deprecated, mark it as such and suggest an alternative.
